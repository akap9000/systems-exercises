Parallel matrix multiplication

build:
$ make compile

clean:
$ make clean

generate input file:
$ python gen.py [file-name] [#rows-matrix1] [#columns-matrix1] [#columns-matrix2]
e.g:
$ python gen.py in.txt 800 1200 800

run:
$ ./mul [#threads] [input-file]
e.g. running single thread multiplication:
$ ./mul 1 in.txt
e.g. running 8-thread multiplication:
$ ./mul 8 in.txt

Notes:
1) [#columns-matrix1] also specifies [#rows-matrix2].
2) For best results, run as many threads as you have cores.
3) mul will print the result to stdout and print below it the time in milliseconds it took to perform the multiplication (doesn't include the time to load the input from the input file and print the output to stdout).
